# Cleanup Pooled Library

## Gather Materials

- [ ] AMPure XP beads
- [ ] 2.0mL Tube Magnet Rack
- [ ] Sterile 2.0mL microcentrifuge tubes
- [ ] Micropipettes (P100, P200)
- [ ] Pipette Tips (100uL, 200uL)
- [ ] 80% Ethanol (made fresh)
- [ ] Nuclease Free Water

## Magnetic Capture

1. Mix 100uL of pooled library with 80uL AMPure XP beads. 
2. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
3. Place tube onto magnet rack and capture for 3 minutes.
5. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, aspirate and discard the supernatant. 
6. Remove from magnet, add 200uL fresh 80% ethanol. Briefly pipette to mix. 
7. Place on magnet rack and capture. 
8. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, aspirate and discard ethanol.
9. Remove from magnet, add 200uL fresh 80% ethanol. Briefly pipette to mix. 
10. Place on magnet rack and capture. 
11. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, aspirate and discard ethanol. 
12. Briefly centrifuge, and recapture. 
13. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, aspirate any residual ethanol at bottom of the tube. Discard. 
14. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, airdry beads for 5 minutes at room temperature until no visible ethanol remains. 
15. Remove from magnet, and add 35uL of nuclease free water and mix well. 
16. Place on magnet rack and capture. 
17. **KEEPING THE TUBE ON THE MAGNET**, transfer supernatant to a fresh tube and quantify using Nanodrop and/or Qubit.
