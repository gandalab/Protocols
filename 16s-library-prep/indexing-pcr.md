# Indexing PCR

*This protocol has been adapted from the protocols of Jordan Bisanz Laboratory at the Pennsylvania State University.*

## Prepare Your Workspace

- [ ] Turn on the PCR Clean Hood blower and white light. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol including work surface and walls. 
- [ ] Turn the dial and run the UV light for at least 10 minutes. 

⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.

- [ ] Once the timer is up and the UV light turns off, you are ready to begin. 

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

## Gather Materials

- [ ] 96-well PCR Plates
- [ ] DMSO
- [ ] KAPA HiFi PCR kit (KAPA KK2502)
- [ ] Indexing Primers
- [ ] Nuclease free water
- [ ] Primary PCR amplicons
- [ ] Plate Films

## Protocol

1. Thaw KAPA HiFi PCR Kit on ice. 
2. Dilute primary PCR amplicons 1:100 in nuclease free water. 
3. Make indexing PCR master mix as outlined in the table below:

**Table 1. Indexing PCR Master Mix**
Reagent | 1 Reaction (20uL) | 110 Reactions (Full Plate)
------|------|------
5X KAPA HiFi Buffer | 4uL | 440uL 
10mM dNTPs | 0.6uL | 66uL
DMSO | 1uL | 110uL
KAPA HiFi Polymerase | 0.4uL | 44uL
**Total** | **6.0uL** | **660uL**

4. To a new 96-well PCR Plate, for each well add:
- [ ] 6uL of Master Mix
- [ ] 4uL of Indexing Primer
- [ ] 10uL of Diluted PCR Amplicons

5. Vortex and centrifuge plate. Place in thermocycler using the indexing amplification parameters as outlined in Table 2. 

**Table 2. Indexing Amplification Parameters.**
Cycle | Temperature | Time
-----|-----|-----
Initial (Denaturation) | 95˚C | 5 minutes
10 Cycles:
Denature | 98˚C | 20 seconds
Anneal | 55˚C | 15 seconds
Extend | 72˚C | 60 seconds
Hold at 4˚C
