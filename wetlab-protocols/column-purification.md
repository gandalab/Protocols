# GeneJET Column Purification

## Theory
Column purification is another method of removing unwanted primer dimers from your sample. This method is not as high throughput as AMPure XP beads, but it can be more successful if you have problems with DNA binding to the beads.

## Before You Begin

If this is your first use of the kit, you need to dilute the Wash Buffer with 100% ethanol as follows: 

**Table. 1 Wash Buffer dilution preparation.**
Reagent | 50 Preps | 250 Preps
------|------|------
Wash Buffer (concentrated) | 9mL | 45mL
Ethanol (100%) | 45mL | 225mL
Total | 54mL | 270mL

*Also, examine the Binding Buffer for precipitates before use. If there are any, warm the solution to 37dC and cool to 25dC before use.*

## Purification

1. Add 1:1 Volume Binding Buffer to PCR Mixture. 
2. Check the Color: 

**Table 2. Color determination of samples for optimal pH.**
Color | Next Steps
-----|-----
Yellow | Optimal pH, you may proceed
Orange or Violet | Add 10uL of 3M Sodium Acetate, pH 5.2 and mix

3. For DNA less than 500bp, add 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol. Mix thoroughly by pipette. *EX: For 15uL of PCR with 15uL Binding Buffer, add 15uL of isopropanol.*
4. Transfer 800uL of the solution to the GeneJET Purification Column.
5. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard the flow through. 
6. Add 700uL of Wash Buffer to the column.
7. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard the flow through. 
8. Centrifuge empty column for additional 1 minute to completely remove any wash buffer. 
9. Transfer the GeneJET purification column to a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube. 
10. Add 30-50uL of Elution Buffer to the column - smaller amounts result in more concentrated DNA.
11. Centrifuge for 1 minute.
12. Store the purified DNA at -80dC.
