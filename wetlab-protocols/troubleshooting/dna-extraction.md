# Troubleshooting your DNA Extraction

- [ ] Positive Control Failure 
Potential Causes and Solutions Include: There are several reasons why a positive control could fail. The first being that the entire kit is bad, and beads are not binding. If this is the case, none of the samples should have high concentrations. If only your positive control failed, redo the extraction with the same lysis buffer â€“ it is possible that you did not have enough bead binding mix in the well with the positive control sample. 

- [ ] Low Concentration or Yield
Potential Causes and Solutions Include: Low yield could be failure on the extraction, or it could be that your samples are just low biomass. You can try and re-extract, but if the concentration is low again, you will need to concentrate your samples using the Speed Vac. See the SOP for Speed Vac Concentration of samples.
