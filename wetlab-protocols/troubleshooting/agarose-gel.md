# Troubleshooting Your Gel

❗No Visible Bands  
**Potential Explanations and Solutions:** No bands in your gel means that the sample did not amplify. You will likely need to redo your PCR or rerun the gel. Sometimes samples do not settle in the well properly and therefore do not run on the gel. Also make sure that you ran your gel the correct way, from black to red. No bands could mean that you ran your samples off the gel. 

❗Failed Ladder  
**Potential Explanations and Solutions:** If your ladder does not look like it is supposed to based off of the image on the -20C fridge, then there are problems with your ladder. Either you did not make the correct solution for the ladder or there was something wrong with the gel. You will have to remake the gel and ladder and redo. 

❗Streaking  
**Potential Explanations and Solutions:** If you see a large amount of streaking on your gel, it's likely that you have too high of a concentration. Dilute your samples and rerun the PCR and gel. 

❗Dimers  
**Potential Explanations and Solutions:** If you see extra bands on your gel at smaller sizes, you may be seeing dimers in your gel. You will need to remove those dimers before proceeding by running AMPure Purification.
