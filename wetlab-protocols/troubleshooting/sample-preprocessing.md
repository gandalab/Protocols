# Troubleshooting Your Samples

❗Stomacher Not Working  
**Potential Causes and Solutions Include:** The stomacher arms are made of rubber material, too thick of a sample can cause problems for this material, make sure that you are not putting too thick of material in the stomacher. 

❗Leaking of Contents  
**Potential Causes and Solutions Include:** If your samples are leaking into the stomacher it is likely that your secondary containment is insufficient. Make sure that you are using a large enough Ziploc bag and that you have the opening/top of the bag at the top of the stomacher.
