# Speed Vac Concentration

## Gather Materials

- [ ] DNA Samples
- [ ] Silica Gel


## Concentration

1. Upon arrival to room 321C, make sure that the speed vac is setup properly. This means that the orange tubes are connected to the clear speed vac tube and the black vacuum tube. See figure 1 for proper setup. 
2. The flask in the center should be properly sealed with the black rubber topper and have a good amount of dry silica gel. Add some to it or remove the old if you think necessary.  
      a. This step is ESSENTIAL so that no liquid gets sucked into the vacuum pump. 
3. Lift the clear lid on the speed vac and load the samples into the rack with the lids OPEN. This is important for evaporation. Load all samples into the equipment balanced, as you would a centrifuge.
4. Close the lid and turn on the vacuum pump using the switch.
5. Set the drying rate to ‘High.’
6. Turn on the concentrator, this will cause the machine to spin. 
7. Once the rotator has reached its normal speed, turn the blue dial on the back of the machine to up and down. This will allow the vacuum to be on the samples. 
8. Check to make sure that you cannot lift the clear lid – this means that the vacuum is sealed properly. 
9. Set a timer for 20 minutes. 


## Remove Your Samples and Quanitfy

1. Once your timer is complete, turn off the vacuum pump. 
2. Turn off the concentrator and wait for it to stop spinning. 
3. Release the vacuum on the machine by turning the blue dial to the left and right. 
4. Lift the lid and remove the samples. Make sure to close the lid of each tube before putting it in the rack. 
5. Quantify your samples using Qubit.
6. If necessary, repeat. You may change the drying rate and the timer.
