# Real Time PCR for RNA 

## Theory 
This protocol is for real time PCR of RNA samples. It includes making cDNA from RNA template DNA and cDNA amplification. 

## Prepare Your Workspace

- [ ] Turn on the PCR Clean Hood blower and white light. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol including work surface and walls. 
- [ ] Turn the dial and run the UV light for at least 10 minutes. 
⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.
- [ ] Once the timer is up and the UV light turns off, you are ready to begin. 

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

## Gather Materials
- [ ] PCR Plate/Tube Rack
- [ ] Adhesive Film
- [ ] PCR Plate or PCR Strip Tubes
- [ ] Micropipettes (P1000, P100, P10)
- [ ] Pipette Tips (1000uL, 100uL, 10uL)
- [ ] VWR Marker
- [ ] 2X Platinum SuperFi RT-PCR Master Mix
- [ ] Forward and Reverse Primers (10uM)
- [ ] Superscript IV RT Mix
- [ ] Nuclease Free Water
- [ ] Template RNA
- [ ] Sterile 5.0mL Centrifuge Tubes

## Master Mix Preparation

1. 1.	In a sterile 5mL centrifuge tube labeled “MM” combine *25uL/sample 2X Platinum Superfi Master Mix, 2.5uL/sample Forward Primer (10uM), 2.5uL/sample Reverse Primer (10uM), 0.5uL/sample Superscript IV RT Mix, and 9.5uL/sample nuclease free water.* 
2.	Vortex and spin down master mix when complete. 
3.	If running a full plate, prepare enough master mix for 100 samples as shown in Table 1. 

**Table 1. Master Mix for 20uL reaction for 100 samples.**
Reagent | Volume/Reaction | Volume/Plate
-----|-----|-----
2X Platinum SuperFi RT-PCR Master Mix | 25uL | 2500uL
Forward Primer (10uM) | 2.5uL | 250uL
Reverse Primer (10uM) | 2.5uL | 250uL
Superscript IV RT Mix | 0.5uL | 50uL
Nuclease Free Water | 9.5uL | 950uL

## Plate Preparation

1.	Add 40uL of Master Mix to each well. 
2.	Add 10uL of Template RNA to each corresponding sample well. Be sure to follow the plate map, create a new PCR plate map, and/or label tubes. 
3.	Add 10uL of nuclease free water to one well that does not have DNA. This is your negative control. 
4.	Add 10uL of RT-PCR Positive Control to one well that does not have DNA. This is your positive control. 

## PCR Reaction

1. Setup thermocycler program as outlined in Table 2. 
2. Vortex and spin down the tubes or plate of samples. Place into the thermocycler and press ‘Start.’
3. Once complete, press ‘Enter’ and remove from thermocycler. Centrifuge tubes before opening. Tubes can be stored at 4°C for short periods of time until ready to run a gel or for longer at -80°C. 

**Table 2. RT-PCR Thermocycler Conditions.**
Step | Temperature | Time | Number of Cycles
----|----|----|----
Reverse Transcription	| 45-60C | 10 minutes | 1
RT inactivation/initial denaturation | 98C | 2 minutes	
Amplification | 98C | 10 seconds| 35-**40**
Amplification | 55-72C | 10 seconds | 
Amplification | 72C | 30 seconds/kb | 
Final Extension | 72C | 5 minutes | 1
