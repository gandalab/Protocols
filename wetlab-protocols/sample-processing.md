# Sample Pre-Processing

## 🥾 BOOT SOCKS (Stomacher)

### Prepare Your Workspace

For aliquoting water, work in the Biological Safety Cabinet.

- [ ] Turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet. This is done by lifting the sash to operating sash height, marked on the left side of the hood. This should turn on the blower, white light, and window alarm. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol, including the work surface, walls, and glass.
- [ ] Lower the sash and press the UV button. This will turn on the UV light for 15 minutes. It will turn off automatically. 

⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

### Gather Materials

- [ ] UltraPure Grade Nuclease Free Water
- [ ] Serological Pipette
- [ ] Serologicla Pipette Tip (5mL, 25mL, 50mL)
- [ ] 2.0mL microcentrifuge tube (2/sample)
- [ ] Gallon Storage Bags
- [ ] Tube Rack
- [ ] VWR Marker

### Stomacher Use

1. Add 20mL sterile water to each boot sock bag and place in larger Ziplock bag. Samples must be completely thawed before stomacher insertion. These samples will take time to thaw but the addition of room temperature water facilitates this. When placing samples in the larger bag, make sure that the whirlpak and the Ziplock bag opening are on the same side. 
2. Place in stomacher, aligning one sock with each paddle. Close slowly to ensure the bag does not slip. 
3. Run on "Normal" setting for 5 minutes. 
4. Using 5mL Serological Pipette, remove 3-4mL of homogenate squeezed out of boot socks and aliquot into two (2) labeled 2.0mL tubes. The amount aliquoted can be approximate, just make sure to leave enough space to allow for expansion when freezing.
5. Store at -80dC.

### Stomacher Use

1. Add 40mL sterile water to each boot sock bag and place in larger Ziplock bag. Samples must be completely thawed before stomacher insertion. These samples will take time to thaw but the addition of room temperature water facilitates this. When placing samples in the larger bag, make sure that the whirlpak and the Ziplock bag opening are on the same side.

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

### Gather Materials

- [ ] Sterile 2.0mL centrifuge tubes
- [ ] Ultra Pure Grade PBS
- [ ] Micropipette (P1000)
- [ ] Pipette Tips (1000uL)
- [ ] Tweezers
- [ ] VWR Marker
- [ ] 70% Ethanol

### Sample Processing

1. Add 1mL PBS to each tube containing the swab. *Note: If original sample containment contains multiple swabs and you are only working with one, transfer the swab you are working with to a new 1.7-2.0mL tube using tweezers. Sterilize tweezers with 70% EtOH between samples.*
2. Homogenize tubes for 30 minutes in Bead Ruptor at 20Hz.
3. Transfer homogenate liquid to new labeled tube using the micropipette.
4. Centrifuge tubes containing homogenate at 14000Xg for 30 minutes.
5. Dump supernatant into tip discard bin.
6. Resuspend pellet in 300uL PBS.
7. Homogenize tubes for 30 minutes in Bead Ruptor at 20Hz.
8. Store in -80dC.
