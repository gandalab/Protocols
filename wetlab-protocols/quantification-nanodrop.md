# DNA Quantification with Nanodrop

## Theory
In order to work with DNA, we need to know how much DNA we have. Nanodrop is a type of spectrophotometer that shines light through the DNA. Since DNA can absorb some light, we can use the amount of light that passes through to determine what concentration of DNA we have. 

## Gather Materials 

- [ ] DNA Elution Plate or Tubes
- [ ] Micropipette (P10)
- [ ] Pipette Tips (10uL)
- [ ] MagMAX Microbiome Elution Buffer

*The Nanodrop is located in room 323C. All supplies can be loaded on the small black cart and taken over there or carried.*

## Quantification

1. Sign log book for Nanodrop usage.
2. Turn on the machine with the power button on the back.
3. Click "dsDNA" from the home screen menu. 
4. Place 1uL of MagMAX Microbiome Elution Buffer onto pedistal to blank. ⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS MACHINE READS "BLANK...OK"
5. Clean top and bottom pedestal with a KimWipe.
6. Place 1uL of DNA sample onto pedestal.
7. Lower top pedestal gently to read.
8. After reading, record ng/uL, A260/280, and A260/230 from the screen. Other information can be recorded but is not necessary. These values will tell you your DNA concentration and the quality of the extracted DNA. 
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for all DNA samples. 
10. When finished, click "End Experiment."
11. Clean pedestals with a KimWipe. 
12. Turn off the Nanodrop with the power button on the back. 
13. Clean entire area with 70% alcohol.
