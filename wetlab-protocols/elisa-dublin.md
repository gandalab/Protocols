## Prepare Solutions

### Dilution Buffer Working Solution

Dilute 5 times in demineralized or distilled water. For one plate, prepare as follows:

**Table 1. Dilution Buffer dilution for one plate.**
Reagent | Volume
-----|-----
Dilution Buffer | 9mL
Demineralized or Distilled Water | 36mL

### Washing Solution

Dilute 200 times in demineralized or distilled water. For one plate, prepare as follows:

**Table 2. Washing Solution dilution for one plate.**
Reagent | Volume
-----|-----
Washing Solution | 2.5mL
Demineralized or Distilled Water | 497.5mL

## Pre-Dilution of Test Samples

1. Dispense 10uL of sample to each well on the dummy plate starting at A2. ❗***LEAVE WELLS A1-F1 EMPTY***❗
2. Dispense 190uL of the dilution buffer working solution prepared above into each well with a sample and mix the contents of the wells. ❗***LEAVE WELLS A1-F1 EMPTY***❗
3. Seal the dummy plate.
4. Place the dummy plate on the incubator shaker and hold down with tape. Shake the dummy plate for 1 minute.

## Incubation of Control and Test Samples

1. Label each strip of the Test Plate (component 1) with a marker pen.
2. Dispense 90uL of the dilution buffer working solution to all wells of the test plate.
3. Transfer 10uL of each well of the dummy plate to the corresponding well on the test plate. ❗***LEAVE WELLS A1-F1 WITH JUST THE 90uL ADDED***❗
4. Dispense 10uL of the Negative Control (component 5) to wells A1 and B1.
5. Dispense 10uL of the Validation Control (component 6) to wells C1 and D1.
6. Dispense 10uL of the Positive Control (component 7) to wells E1 and F1. 
7. Seal the test plate. 
8. Place the test plate on the incubator shaker and hold down with table. Shake the test plate for 1 minutes. 
9. Incubate the test plate for 60±5 minutes at room temperature. 

## Incubate with Conjugate

1. Prepare conjugate dilution by mixing conjugate (component 4) with the dolution buffer working solution prepared above as follows for one plate: 

**Table 3. Conjugate dilution for one plate.**
Reagent | Volume
-----|-----
Conjugate | 0.4mL
Dilution Buffer Working Solution | 11.6mL

2. Empty the test plate by turning over onto a paper towel. Tap several times to remove all the liquid.
3. Wash **6 TIMES** with 250uL of washing solution prepared above. Tap on a paper towel each time to remove all the liquid.
4. Dispense 100uL of the conjugate dilution to all wells.
5. Seal the plate.
6. Incubate for 60±5 minutes at room temperature.

## Incubate with Chromogen Substrate

1. Empty the test plate by turning over onto a paper towel. Tap several times to remove all the liquid.
2. Wash **6 TIMES** with 250uL of washing solution prepared above. Tap on a paper towel each time to remove all the liquid.
3. Dispense 100uL of the Chromogen (TMB) Substrate (component 8) to all wells.
4. Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. 
5. Add 100uL of the Stop Solution (component 9) to all wells. Pipette to mix. **Make sure to add in the same order as you added the Chromogen (TMB) Substrate.**

## Reading the Test and Calculating Results

1.	Measure optical density of all the wells at 450nm within 15 minutes of adding the stop solution. Use the OD Plate reader in Dr. Ott's lab, located in room 322C. Instructions for operation of this machine are posted by the machine. *Make sure you have been trained by the appropriate person before using.*
2.	Calculate the mean OD value of the Negative Controls (A1, B1).
3.	Calculate the mean OD value of the Positive Control (E1, F1).
4.	Calculate the corrected OD value of the Positive Control and Validation Controls by subtracting the mean OD of the Negative Control.
5.	Calculate the percent positivity of all controls and test samples using the below formula:

**Figure 1. Forumla for calculating percent positivity.**

## Result Interpretation

1.	The mean OD of the Negative Control must be < 0.4.
2.	The OD of the Positive Control (not corrected) should be > 1.000.
3.	The percent positivity of the Validation Control must be ≥ 30%. 
4.	Use the below table to determine the percent positivity interpretation of each of the samples in the test plate. 

**Table 4. Percent positivity value meanings.**
Percent Positivity Value | Result | Meaning
------|------|------
PP = < 35% | Negative | *Salmonella*-speicific antibodies are absent in test sample
PP = > 35% | Positive | *Salmonella*-speicific antibodies are present in test sample
