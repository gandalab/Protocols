# Media Preparation - Plates and Broth

## Theory
When growing bacteria in the lab, you will need to make plates and/or broth for proper growth. 

## Prepare Your Workspace

- [ ] Turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet. This is done by lifting the sash to operating sash height, marked on the left side of the hood. This should turn on the blower, white light, and window alarm. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol, including the work surface, walls, and glass.
- [ ] Lower the sash and press the UV button. This will turn on the UV light for 15 minutes. It will turn off automatically. 

⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

## Gather Materials

- [ ] Petri Dishes (whatever size is applicable)
- [ ] Appropriate Agar Type
- [ ] Any Additives (i.e. Rabbit Blood)
- [ ] Purified Water
- [ ] Funnel (autoclaved following last use + cleaned with ethanol prior to hood placement)
- [ ] Addition Supplies (i.e. needle and syringe if using rabbit blood)

## Preparation of Plates

1. According to manufacturer specifications, combine appropriate weight agar powder with appropriate volume purified water in a Erlenmeyer flask on hot plate with stir bar until combined and no clumps remain.
2.	Cover with foil and autoclave. Use Liquid setting on the autoclave.
3.	If adding additional components such as blood, allow to cool in safety cabinet until inner forearm can be held against flask for 10 seconds or until it reaches the temperature appropriate for the additive. 
4.	Arrange empty plates in a few columns of 3-4 at a time and remove lids.
5.	Using funnel and working back to front, aliquot ~5mL agar into each plate, swirling if necessary to ensure the full bottom surface is covered
6.	Repeat until all agar is used.
7.	Partially cover each plate with its lid and allow to set up for ~1 hour.
8.	Replace lids entirely for each plate and store inverted to prevent condensation build up on agar surface. Place the plates in a plastic sleeve (the same one the empty plates were in) and store in the 4dC fridge in 330D. ***Make sure to label sleeves of plates with date plates were made, agar type, total count, and initials.***

## Preparation of Broth

1.	According to manufacturer specifications, combine appropriate weight agar powder with appropriate volume purified water in a Erlenmeyer flask on hot plate with stir bar until combined and no clumps remain.
2.	Carefully transfer to clean bottle with screw cap/resealable cap.
3.	Autoclave using the liquid setting. Make sure to leave the lid LOOSE on the bottle during autoclaving.
4.	Allow to cool and seal the bottle and store in the 4dC fridge in 330D. ***Make sure to label with date broth was made, broth type, total volume, and initials.***
