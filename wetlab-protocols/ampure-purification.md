# AMPure XP Purification

## Theory
After completion of PCR, there can be an excessive amount of primers left over which can impact the quality of your downstream analyses and reactions. These dimers can bind and cause your experiments to not work correctly. Removing them is the best way to ensure you are only focusing on the samples you want. 

## Gather Materials

- [ ] 70% Ethanol
- [ ] AMPure XP Reagent
- [ ] PCR Sample(s)
- [ ] Micropipettes (P100, P200)
- [ ] Pipette Tips (100uL, 200uL)
- [ ] PCR 96-Well Plate or PCR Tube Strips
- [ ] Eppendorf 96 Super Magnet Plate
- [ ] Nuclease Free Water

## Purification

1. Vortex AMPure XP bottle for 5-10 seconds to resuspend magnetic beads. Allow to warm to room temperature (at least 30 minutes). 
2. Add AMPure XP according to the sample reaction volume: 

**Table 1. AMPure XP volume per reaction volume.**
Sample Reaction Volume (uL) | AMPure XP Volume (uL)*
------|------
10 | 18
15 | 27
17 | 31
20 | 36
50 | 90
100 | 180  

**Volume of AMPure XP per reaction = 1.8 x Reaction Volume*

3. Mix reagent and sample by pipette mixing 10 times.
4. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
5. Place reaction plate onto 96 Super Magnet Plate for 2 minutes.
6. **KEEPING REACTION PLATE ON MAGNET PLATE**, aspirate the cleared solution.
7. **KEEPING REACTION PLATE ON MAGNET PLATE**, dispense 100uL of 70% ethanol into each well and incubate for 30 seconds at room temperature.
8. **KEEPING REACTION PLATE ON MAGNET PLATE**, aspirate 100uL of ethanol and discard.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8.
10. Remove reaction plate from magnet plate. 
11. Add 40uL of nuclease free water to each well and pipette mix 10 times. Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes. 
12. Place reaction plate onto magnet plate for one minute. 
13. **KEEPING REACTION PLATE ON MAGNET PLATE**, transfer 35uL of eluate to a new plate. This is your purified sample.
