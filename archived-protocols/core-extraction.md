# DNA Extraction - MagMAX CORE Kit

## Theory

## Prepare Your Workspace

- [ ] Turn on the Biological Safety Cabinet. This is done by lifting the sash to operating sash height, marked on the left side of the hood. This should turn on the blower, white light, and window alarm. 
- [ ] Clean the cabinet with 70% ethanol, including the work surface, walls, and glass.
- [ ] Lower the sash and press the UV button. This will turn on the UV light for 15 minutes. It will turn off automatically. 

⚠️ You cannot expect the glass to protect you from UV exposure. You can be in a different part of the lab while the light is running, but do not loiter in front of the cabinet.

*Remember, before placing any objects in the hood, they must be sprayed with 70% ethanol.*

## Sample Preparation

1. Add 1mL of PBS to each tube containing the swab.
2. Homogenize tubes for 30 minutes.
3. Transfer swabs to new tubes. Keep them frozen.
4. Centrifuge tubes containing the homogenized samples at 14,000 x g for 30 minutes. 
5. Suspend pellets in 300uL of PBS.
6. Homogenize tubes for 30 minutes.
7. Keep samples at -80dC until processing. 


## Reagent and Plate Preparation

1. Make Lysis Solution as per MagMAX CORE Lysis Solution, which includes 450 µl/reaction of MagMAX CORE Lysis Solution and 2.05 µl/reaction of Reagent DX (Qiagen, cat. # 19088). After the addition of each component of the Lysis Buffer, be sure to thoroughly vortex the solution. Keep the solution at room temperature. The prepared lysis buffer can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours.
2. Prepare Bead/Proteinase K Mix as per recipe: 20 µl/reaction of MagMAX CORE Magnetic Beads and 10 µl/reaction of MagMAX CORE Proteinase K (20 mg/mL). It’s recommended to prepare Bead/Proteinase K mix daily, but this can be stored at 4°C for up to one week.
3. Prepare Wash 1 plate by adding 500 µL of MagMAX CORE Wash Solution 1 to each well of a deep well plate (make sure that you label the plate as WASH 1).
4. Prepare Wash 2 plate by adding 500 µL of MagMAX CORE Wash Solution 2 to each well of a deep well plate (make sure that you label the plate as WASH 2).
5. Prepare Elution plate by adding 90 µL of MagMAX CORE Elution Buffer to each well of a standard plate (make sure that you label the plate with worklist date).


## Sample Preparation

1. Add 450 µl of lysis buffer (step 5.2) to each zirconia bead tube corresponding to a sample.
2. Pipet to mix and transfer 200 µl of sample to the zirconia tube in a biological safety cabinet. 
3. Be sure that all caps are inserted into the tubes to the same depth.
4. Place the bead tube rack in the Bead-Ruptor 96 (Omni, cat. #SKU: 27- 0001) using the appropriate lid.
5. Bead beat the samples at 20 Hz for 2.5 min. Rest for 5 min, and bead beat for an additional at 20 Hz for 2.5 min. Be sure to switch off and unplug the Bead-Ruptor 96.
6. Centrifuge samples at 2,500 rpm for 5 min (Be sure to put the plate rotor correctly).
7. Invert the tube of Bead/Proteinase K and vortex to mix several times to resuspend the beads. Then add 30 µl of Bead/Proteinase K mix to the required wells on the deep well plate labelled “Sample”.
8. Using the decapper (ISC BioExpress, cat. # P-8754-04), remove the caps from the tubes. Discard the caps into the waste container.
9. Transfer 500 µl of lysate from bead tubes to the sample plate with bead mix. Be careful not to transfer any zirconia/silica beads. Seal the plate
10. Using the ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf, cat. # 2231000574) shake sealed sample plate at 1400 rpm for 2 min.
11. Unseal the sample plate and add 350 µl of MagMAX CORE Binding Solution to each sample well. Immediately proceed to magnetic particle processor (KingFisher Flex).

## Setting Up Equipment

1. Turn on the KingFisher Flex. Push the right arrow to select “user” then the down arrow to select “DNA”. Toggle down to the “MagMAX_Core_Flex” program and then push start.
2. Load each of the plates according to the display’s instructions, pressing start after each plate is loaded. Be sure the orientation of the plate is correct (A1 is in the A1 location).
3. Press start and record usage in the logbook.
4. The program runs approximately 27 minutes. The first plate to be removed is the Elution plate, which now contains the eluted DNA. Place a lid over this plate, label it with the worklist date, and seal it with parafilm. Place the plate with the eluted DNA on ice. Al other plates can be placed in a ziplock bag and discarded in the biohazard waste, except for the unlabeled plate that held the comb, which can be reused.
5. Turn off the KingFisher Flex and wipe down with DNA away solution (Thermo Scientific, cat. # 7000).
6. The elution plate can now be used for bacterial whole genome sequencing methods.
